The Teleport Design System is built using [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) and is designed to be used across all
Teleport products. It provides a consistent look and feel, as well as a set of reusable components that can be used to
build user interfaces quickly and efficiently.

There are some concepts that are important to understand when working with the design system:

## Styling

## Theming

Tokens and recipes are the building blocks of the design system's theme. They allow for consistent styling across
all components and make it easy to update the look and feel of the entire application.

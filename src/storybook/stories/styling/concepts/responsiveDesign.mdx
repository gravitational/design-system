The design system has built-in support for responsive design, allowing you to create styles that adapt to different screen sizes.
The breakpoints are defined in <GitHubFileLink to="src/theme/breakpoints.ts" /> and are as follows:

<CodeBlock>{breakpoints}</CodeBlock>

You can specify styles for different screen sizes a few different ways.

## Object Syntax

You can use the breakpoint size as a prop to apply different styles.

```tsx
<Text fontWeight="normal" lg={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
  This text is normal weight on small screens and bold on large screens.
</Text>
```

Or you can pass an object to a style prop with keys for each breakpoint.

```tsx
<Text fontWeight={{ base: 'normal', lg: 'bold' }}>
  This text is normal weight on small screens and bold on large screens.
</Text>
```

## Array Syntax

You can also use an array syntax to specify styles for different breakpoints. The first value is for the base size, the second for the first breakpoint, and so on.

```tsx
<Text fontWeight={['normal', /* sm */ undefined, /* md */ undefined, 'bold']}>
  This text is normal weight on small screens and bold on large screens.
</Text>
```

You need to include `undefined` for any breakpoints you want to skip.

## Breakpoint targeting

### Breakpoint range

You can target a range of breakpoints using the `To` notion. This can be used both in an object and as a prop.

For example, to target between the `sm` and `lg` breakpoints:

```tsx
<Text fontWeight={{ smToLg: 'bold' }}>
  This text is bold between the sm and lg breakpoints.
</Text>
```

Or as a prop:

```tsx
<Text fontWeight="normal" smToLg={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
  This text is bold between the sm and lg breakpoints.
</Text>
```

### Only breakpoint

You can target a specific breakpoint using the `Only` notion. This can be used both in an object and as a prop.

For example, to target only the `md` breakpoint:

```tsx
<Text fontWeight={{ mdOnly: 'bold' }}>
  This text is bold only at the md breakpoint.
</Text>
```

Or as a prop:

```tsx
<Text fontWeight="normal" mdOnly={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
  This text is bold only at the md breakpoint.
</Text>
```

## Hiding elements at specific breakpoints

You can use the `hideFrom` and `hideBelow` props to hide elements at specific breakpoints.

To hide an element from the `md` breakpoint and up:

```tsx
<Box hideFrom="md">This box is hidden from the md breakpoint and up.</Box>
```

To hide an element below the `md` breakpoint:

```tsx
<Box hideBelow="md">This box is hidden below the md breakpoint.</Box>
```
